# **A HackPVD Project**

Project Summary
---------------

I had to learn about data and how to manipulate it to display on a Leaflet.js map, I had an incredibly hard time parsing the data, I had to learn some JavaScript skills to get to display the map and I haven't even finished putting it on a map!

I learned the [RI Open Data](http://www.ri.gov/data/ "open data") was a [2D Array](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~mrmiller/15-110/Handouts/arrays2D.pdf "2dimensional array")

[destructuring](http://raganwald.com/2015/02/02/destructuring.html "destructuring")
